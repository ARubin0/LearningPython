# TODO
# XXX * Need more townsfolk âˆš ADDED 10 more. if more are needed.https://www.name-generator.org.uk/?i=c
# XXX * makeCustomer function should roll the randInt for us
# XXX * add random events for when there are no customers (its a func)
# XXX * add random events for when there are customers (its the same func, different argument)
# XXX * add 2 cooking implements.   For example, riceCooker takes rawRice, returns cookedRice.  If input is not rawRice

# XXX add 1 cook
# XXX add ingredients + dish pairings that work on cooking implements.  e.g. ingredients: rawRice, makes: cookedRice
# XXX add days, 24 hours, Diner closes from 1AM to 6AM.  event loop is 1 tick per hour.
# XXX customers should only show up once, i.e. Bobby Smith does not have a clone
# XXX add waiters
# XXX add cooks
# XXX add cooking implements 
# XXX add tables
# XXX one waiter can serve 1 customer per hour.
