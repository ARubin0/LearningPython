Difference between  # A and B is 8 and 13 heads tabbed in when it shouldnt be otherwise it "breaks" the code otherwise code continues to print 
coin without looking at if function. in A heads is only incramented if less than 5 , in b it is incramented every time

#A
    if coin   <= 5 :
        print("Heads")
    	  heads += 1
 
#B
    if coin   <= 5 :
        print("Heads")
    heads += 1

 #   Boolean logicâ€¦ basically means and or not and combos of them.
#   example
   if( coin >= 6 and coin <= 10 )    #means
   if( (coin >= 6) and (coin <= 10) )  #which evaluates to
   if( true and true )  # which evaluates to 
   If ( true )
#  a List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members-
    ( members are words/numbers in the list [ie] Number (1),(1) or names/words [ie] (james),(james) 



###Function V Function Call
 # line 30 is correct. Variable 'Coin' is being set to the call to 'getflip'.
    coin = GetFlip(HeadNum,TailNum,EdgeNum) 
    #line 32 is Wrong. variable 'coin' is being set to the  GetFlip Funciton. (which is just a function. not the call to the function)
    #coin = GetFlip 
  

make another function more complicated than coinflip 3 numbers less than or = heads greater than or = tails greater than or equal to the third number it is edge
