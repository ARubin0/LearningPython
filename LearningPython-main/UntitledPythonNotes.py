Difference between  # A and B is 8 and 13 heads tabbed in when it shouldnt be otherwise it "breaks" the code otherwise code continues to print 
coin without looking at if function. in A heads is only incramented if less than 5 , in b it is incramented every time

#A
    if coin   <= 5 :
        print("Heads")
    	  heads += 1
 
#B
    if coin   <= 5 :
        print("Heads")
    heads += 1

 #   Boolean logicâ€¦ basically means and or not and combos of them.
#   example
   if( coin >= 6 and coin <= 10 )    #means
   if( (coin >= 6) and (coin <= 10) )  #which evaluates to
   if( true and true )  # which evaluates to 
   If ( true )
#  a List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members-
    ( members are words/numbers in the list [ie] Number (1),(1) or names/words [ie] (james),(james) 


Calling a Function
To call a function, use the function name followed by parenthesis

###Function V Function Call
 # line 30 is correct. Variable 'Coin' is being set to the call to 'getflip'.
    coin = GetFlip(HeadNum,TailNum,EdgeNum) 
    #line 32 is Wrong. variable 'coin' is being set to the  GetFlip Funciton. (which is just a function. not the call to the function)
    #coin = GetFlip 
  

make another function more complicated than coinflip 3 numbers less than or = heads greater than or = tails greater than or equal to the third number it is edge



### Correct Layout For Python Code File name is  CoinFlip3GetFlipFunction.py
"""
#!/usr/bin/env python

import random #Library


#GetFlip returns a number from 0 to EdgeNum
def GetFlip(HeadNum,TailNum, EdgeNum):
    #HeadNum and TailNum are Used later
    return random.randint(0,EdgeNum)


if __name__ == "__main__":  

    flips = 1 #initaializing flips
    heads = 0
    tails = 0
    edge = 0
    HeadNum=5
    TailNum=10
    EdgeNum=11
    while flips  <= 10:  
        
        # line below is correct. Variable 'Coin' is being set to the call to 'getflip'.
        coin = GetFlip(HeadNum,TailNum,EdgeNum) 
        flips +=1 #incramenting
        if  coin   <= HeadNum :
            print("Heads")
            heads += 1
        elif coin  <= TailNum :
            print("tails")
            tails += 1
        elif coin == EdgeNum:
            print ("edge")
            edge +=1
        

    print("You got " + str(heads) +  " heads, " + str(tails) + " tails, and " + "on its edge " + str(edge))

#XXX how to approach coding a new function
    0. review paper function thing 
        for now, re lable one coppy and compare it to master copy
    1. look at how the function is being callled
        for example. put the function call above the function def to remember what it is
    2. understand what the function arguments  REALLY  are reread function calls and defs before using them...
        see the args as they actually are. dont think.
        for ex, def each arg above funct. 
    3.before each component in the body write a comment describing what it will do. 
        for example.     # cook looks up order in cookbook to find recipe
    4. open python interpriter and look at components of code, then, try to access the part that is needed
        for ex, create temp file in myDiner, import temp to python interpreter (CMD), temp.getCookBook 
>           CB=temp.getCookBook()
            for x,y in CB.items():
