# XXX * if more townsfolk needed.https://www.name-generator.org.uk/?i=c
# XXX add days, 24 hours, Diner closes from 1AM to 6AM.  event loop is 1 tick per hour.
# XXX add cooks âˆš
# XXX add cooking implements 
# XXX one waiter can serve 1 customer per hour.
# XXX IDEAS III/ Questions QQQ/ ZZZ later code things

# QQQ can another function be added to randomly have the  
#   customer decide if they want to order anything else  i/e "wait no how about blank instead" and,  "ill also have this"
# QQQ Line 76-86 r menu. want to be able to "remove drinks" from menu with append as if the tap runs dry
#  CTRL G is shortcut to type to the line of code you want to go to
# ZZZ   FOR LATER
#   physical objects being salt and pepper shaker for food
#   monetary values for food  on the menu and tipping for service
#   dirty dishes on the table/ make the table un useable until the table is cleaned off
#   use input command before/after code to add townsfolk but not allow for duplicants or random letters?
